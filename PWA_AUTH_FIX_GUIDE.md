# PWA Authentication & Caching Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
The PWA was experiencing issues where:
- After login, users would see "Hi user" instead of their actual username
- Data would keep loading indefinitely
- Logging out and back in didn't resolve the issue
- Only clearing app data/cookies would fix it temporarily

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Aggressive Service Worker Caching**: API responses were being cached, causing stale user data
2. **Session Persistence Issues**: Auth sessions were not properly validated for freshness
3. **Missing Visibility/Focus Handlers**: App didn't refresh data when becoming visible again
4. **No Cache Busting**: API calls didn't include cache-control headers

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Service Worker with Smart Caching (`/public/service-worker.js`)
- **Network-first strategy for API calls**: Never caches user data, profiles, or transactions
- **Cache-first strategy for static assets**: Images, CSS, JS files are cached for offline use
- **Automatic cache invalidation**: Old caches are cleared on service worker update
- **Offline fallback**: Shows appropriate messages when offline

Key features:
```javascript
// API endpoints that should NEVER be cached
const NO_CACHE_PATTERNS = [
  /\/auth\//,
  /\/profiles/,
  /\/purchases/,
  /\/credentials/,
  /\/transactions/,
  /\/wallet/,
  /supabase\.co/,
  /\/rest\/v1\//
];
```

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Context (`/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Force refresh on login**: Always fetches fresh profile data
- **Visibility change detection**: Refreshes stale data when app becomes visible
- **Network status monitoring**: Refreshes data when coming back online
- **Session timestamp tracking**: Knows when data was last fetched
- **Service worker sync integration**: Responds to sync requests from SW

Key improvements:
- Added `lastProfileFetch` state to track data freshness
- Profile data older than 5 minutes is automatically refreshed
- Force refresh parameter added to `fetchUserProfile()`

### 3. Improved Supabase Configuration (`/src/utils/supabase.ts`)
- **Custom storage with expiry**: Sessions expire after 30 minutes
- **Session validation**: Checks token expiry before using
- **Cache-control headers**: Prevents browser caching of API responses
- **Corrupted data handling**: Automatically removes invalid session data

### 4. Data Context Enhancements (`/src/contexts/DataContext.tsx`)
- **Visibility change handling**: Refreshes data when app becomes visible
- **Online/offline detection**: Refreshes when connection restored
- **Timestamp tracking**: Knows when data was last refreshed
- **Service worker sync**: Responds to sync events

### 5. PWA Utilities (`/src/utils/pwaUtils.ts`)
New utility functions for PWA management:
- `clearPWACache()`: Clears all caches while preserving remember-me data
- `updateServiceWorker()`: Forces service worker update
- `isPWA()`: Detects if running as installed PWA
- `handleStaleDataDetected()`: Recovery function for stale data
- `initPWASessionManagement()`: Auto-clears expired sessions
- `debugStorage()`: Debug function (available as `window.pwaDebug()`)

### 6. Main App Integration (`/src/main.tsx` & `/src/App.tsx`)
- Service worker registration with update detection
- Visibility change event listeners
- Online/offline status monitoring
- Automatic expired session cleanup
- PWA session management initialization

## How It Works Now

### On App Start:
1. Service worker registers and checks for updates
2. Expired sessions are automatically cleared
3. Fresh data is fetched from the server
4. Session management initializes

### On Login:
1. Authentication happens normally
2. Profile is fetched with `forceRefresh: true`
3. Session is stored with expiry timestamp
4. Data contexts reload user-specific data

### When App Becomes Visible (PWA resumed):
1. App checks how long it's been since last data refresh
2. If > 5 minutes, automatically refreshes profile and data
3. Service worker clears any cached API responses

### When Network Reconnects:
1. App detects online status change
2. Automatically refreshes user profile
3. Data contexts reload all data

### Service Worker Behavior:
- **Static assets**: Cached for offline use
- **API calls**: Always fetch from network, never cached
- **Auth data**: Validated and expired sessions removed
- **Updates**: Automatically activated and old caches cleared

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Install as PWA:
```bash
# On Chrome/Edge:
1. Visit the website
2. Click install icon in address bar
3. Or go to menu > "Install Starline Networks..."

# On iOS Safari:
1. Visit the website
2. Tap share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
```

### 2. Test Authentication:
```bash
1. Open PWA and login
2. Note the username displayed
3. Close the PWA completely
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Reopen PWA - should show correct username
6. Data should load without issues
```

### 3. Debug in Console:
```javascript
// Check PWA status and storage
window.pwaDebug()

// Check auth state
window.authDebug.getAuthState()

// Force data refresh
window.authDebug.forceProfileRecovery()

// Clear all caches (nuclear option)
await window.authDebug.clearAllAndReload()
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the service worker**: Ensure `/public/service-worker.js` is accessible
2. **Clear CDN cache**: If using a CDN, clear cache for the service worker
3. **Version bump**: Update service worker version when making changes
4. **Test on multiple devices**: iOS and Android behave differently

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- Session expiry errors in console
- Service worker update frequency
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Data refresh frequency

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Issue**: User still sees "Hi user"
**Solution**: Check if service worker is registered and active

**Issue**: Data not loading
**Solution**: Check network tab for failed API calls, verify auth token

**Issue**: Old data after login
**Solution**: Ensure force refresh is working in login function

**Issue**: PWA not updating
**Solution**: Check service worker registration and update mechanism

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, you can disable the service worker:
1. Remove service worker registration from `main.tsx`
2. Set `persistSession: false` in Supabase config
3. Deploy and have users clear their app data once

## Future Improvements

1. **Background Sync API**: Use for offline actions
2. **Push Notifications**: Notify users of important updates
3. **Periodic Background Sync**: Refresh data in background
4. **IndexedDB**: Store data locally for true offline support
5. **Workbox**: Consider using Google's Workbox for more sophisticated caching

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Run `window.pwaDebug()` to see storage state
3. Check service worker status in DevTools > Application > Service Workers
4. Verify network requests in DevTools > Network tab

Remember: PWAs cache aggressively by design. This fix ensures user data is never cached while still providing offline support for static assets.
